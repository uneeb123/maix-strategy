- This repo executes trading strategies
- We have the following folders: core, lib, prisma, strategies and tests
- When adding a new trading strategy, add them to the strategies folder and make sure to add them to the strategies/config.json file.
- The trading strategy should not be in any folder except strategies.
- All tests should be written in /tests folder
- Any functionality that is relevant for execution but not a strategy itself should go in /core
- The core should be agnostic of strategy
- All helper methods that are not related executing trade or backtesting should go in /utils
- The tests for core should be under /tests/core and for strategies it should be under /tests/strategies
